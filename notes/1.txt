Iterators can be used to iterate over different data types.
i.e. an Array, a Map, custom data structure etc.

All iterators in rust implement the Iterator trait {like a interface in Java}. 
When defining an Iterator, you have to specify the type, and that type will be 
returned from the next() method.


what is Some(&1)?
- this is one of the variants of the Option Enum that can be returned
pub enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
- 

You can run tests with `cargo test`
